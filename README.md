# Events Calendar

## Requirements / Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an Events Calendar using React and TypeScript. The calendar should allow users to view and navigate between different months, click on specific days, and display a modal when a day is clicked. The stack used for this project is React and TypeScript because of their flexibility and strong typing.

## Build Steps

To build and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd event-calendar`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Design Goals / Approach

The design goals for this project were to create a simple and intuitive Events Calendar interface. The calendar is implemented using React components, and the logic is organized to handle the navigation between months and the display of the modal. The code follows best practices for component structure and separation of concerns.

## Features

-   Display of a calendar with the current month title and a grid of clickable day cells.
-   Modal appears when a day cell is clicked (currently empty).
-   Navigation between months to view upcoming and previous months.
-   BONUS: Day, week, and month view of the calendar (to be implemented).

## Known Issues

-   No known issues at the moment.

## Future Goals

Given more time, the following features could be added:

-   Implement day, week, and month views of the calendar.
-   Add functionality to the modal for creating and editing events.
-   Improve styling and responsiveness of the calendar interface.

## Struggles and Challenges

During the development process, the following challenges were encountered:

-   Struggle 1: TESTING- Installing libraries and get it properly working. I had differences on my previous versions and I struggled configuring jest.config.js and package.json.
-   Struggle 2: SCSS. At first I didn't installed scss properly so I had issues to format my code with scss, after reading documentation I found out I've not installed correctly at first.
